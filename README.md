### About
In my diverse career in Information Technology, Iâ€™ve embraced numerous opportunities and tackled various challenges as a FullStack developer. Iâ€™ve led development teams and coordinated projects as a Tech Lead, managing teams, collaborating with team members, setting goals, assigning tasks, and ensuring project deliveries meet deadlines and quality standards. My software architecture knowledge includes patterns like MVC, MVVM (ModelView-ViewModel), Hexagonal Architecture, Clean Architecture, and Design Patterns. I apply these principles to build a robust and scalable foundation for my projects, ensuring modular, maintainable, and testable code. Iâ€™ve developed scalable applications of medium to large scale, including APIs, Microservices, or Legacy Systems. I have solid expertise in various technologies like Node, ReactJS, Python, Docker, and Kubernetes. As an advocate of DevSecOps practices, I integrate security into all stages of the development lifecycle. I hold a GitLab certification and have experience with GitHub, BitBucket, Ansible, Terraform, Jenkins, Grafana, Prometheus, ELK Stack, and resource management for AWS and Azure Cloud. My skills also encompass setting up and optimizing CI/CD pipelines, automating tests, and conducting detailed security analyses.
